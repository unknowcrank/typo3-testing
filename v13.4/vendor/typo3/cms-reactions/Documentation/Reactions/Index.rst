        A basic reaction shipped with the system extension can be used
        to create records triggered and enriched by data from the
        caller.

    ..  card:: :ref:`Custom reaction type <custom-reaction-type>`

        A custom reaction type may be useful, if the "Create database
        record" type is not sufficient.
