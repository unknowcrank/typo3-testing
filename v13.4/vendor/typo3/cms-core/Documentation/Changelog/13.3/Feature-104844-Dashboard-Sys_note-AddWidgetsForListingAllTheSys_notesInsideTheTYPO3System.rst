====================================================================================
Feature: #104844 - Add widgets for listing all the sys_notes inside the TYPO3 system
====================================================================================

See :issue:`104844`

Description
===========

To make it easier for TYPO3 users to view all the internal notes (EXT:sys_note) in
their TYPO3 system, TYPO3 now offers dashboard widgets for each internal note type.
The backend user must have access to the sys_note table and view permission to the
page where the record is located.

Impact
======

TYPO3 users who have access to the :guilabel:`Dashboard` module and are
granted access to the new widgets can now add and use these widgets.
