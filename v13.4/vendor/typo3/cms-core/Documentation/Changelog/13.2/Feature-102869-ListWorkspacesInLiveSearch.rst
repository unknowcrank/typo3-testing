================================================
Feature: #102869 - List workspaces in LiveSearch
================================================

See :issue:`102869`

Description
===========

The backend LiveSearch is now able to list workspaces a backend user has access
to, offering the possibility to switch to a workspace quickly outside the
Workspaces module.


Impact
======

Backend users now have another, quickly accessible way to access a workspace.
With proper permissions, a backend user may also switch to the edit interface of
a workspace to configure its settings.
