==========================================================
Feature: #97664 - Add search functionality to form manager
==========================================================

See :issue:`97664`

Description
===========

It can be difficult for an editor to find the right form definition to edit, if
there are many form definitions in the system.
To make it easier, a search field is displayed in the form manager.
This allows a case-insensitive search by name or persistenceIdentifier.


Impact
======

It's now possible to search for a form definition inside the form manager
backend module.

.. index:: Backend, ext:form
