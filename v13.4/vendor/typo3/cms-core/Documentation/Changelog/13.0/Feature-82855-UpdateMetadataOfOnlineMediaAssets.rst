Feature: #82855 - Update Metadata of online media assets
=========================================================

See :issue:`82855`

Description
===========

A new action :guilabel:`Reload Metadata` has been added to the secondary
options' dropdown of online media assets, such as YouTube and Vimeo videos,
in the :guilabel:`File > Filelist` module. Additionally, also the context menu of
such files has been extended for the new action.

The action allows to reload the corresponding information from the external
service. That information is, for example, the preview image, the author or the
dimensions of the online media asset.

Impact
======

It's now possible to reload the Metadata of an online media asset using the
new :guilabel:`Reload Metadata` action.
